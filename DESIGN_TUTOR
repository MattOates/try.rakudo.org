IDEA:
- remotely call client-side Javascript from server-side Perl6 to trigger
  UI changes outside the console environment

ISSUES:
- additionl processing has to be done on Rakudo output to identify if it is of 
  a certain, yet to be determined form
- remote calls must be complete to be executed, so the frontend has to detect
  RPCs and defer display until it has received all relevant output;
  in principle, this could be done without changing the backend, but the imo 
  cleaner design would be if this is detected as soon as possible so
  that the messages can be flagged accordingly;
  we might also always defer displaying output till Rakudo is blocking
  on input anyway as that's what IO::Pty::HalfDuplex currently provides

PROSPECT:
- continuing the frontend development with disregard of these issues
- the client-side UI code can be written independently, whatever form
  the tutor might finally take
- implementing the tutor in server-side Perl6 will hurt responsiveness, but
  it might be worth it just for the heck of it
