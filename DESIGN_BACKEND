loop {
	if(socket from fontend available [non-blocking]) {
		accept socket [blocking]
		change session status to busy (DB)
		pipe all input from socket to rakudo process [blocking]
		close socket
	}
	if(rakudo output available) {
		read (complete or partial?) output [non-blocking]
		write output to session (DB)
		if(no more rakudo output) {
			change session status to active (DB)
		}
	}
}

NOTE: the frontend doesn't accept any new input if the session is busy;
the sessions status is only ever changed in the backend
this should solve all race-condition/action at a distance issues
