CPAN dependencies:
    Web Server: Mojolicious, IO::Socket
   REPL Server: POE, IO::Pty::HalfDuplex, Time::HiRes, Date::Format


To configure the REPL Server you need to have a .config file in the directory
you will run the REPL Server from. 

My REPL Server config was generated with: 

    echo "`which perl6` `pwd`/p6safe.pl" >> .config

It should contain: 

   /path/to/perl6 /path/to/p6safe.pl

The path to the input text inside p6safe.pl might need to be 
modified if you move any of the files around, in that case
the first line of p6safe.pl contains the path to the file and
you should only need to correct that one file path.


The web server can be run by doing:

   perl try-rakudo.pl daemon

This will run a basic web server on localhost:3000. For more
details on configuring the web server please referrer to the 
Mojolicious documentation.
